Scenario: 
This is a data set which contains over 65K attempts to access a firewall. There is a single categorical feature 
“Action”, that contains 4 categories – “allow, deny, drop, reset-both”. 
Your task is to create a classification model that will predict the class of incoming traffic to the firewall. 
Requirements 
You are required to use the dataset contained within the file “log2.csv” and then perform the following 
analysis by testing at least 2 classification algorithms: 
 Perform an initial analysis of the data (EDA) using python in your Jupyter notebook. Discuss your 
findings and what relevance they might have on your planned classification algorithms. [0-20]
 Perform any preparation of the data, that you feel is necessary, using python in your Jupyter 
notebook. Explain your rationale behind your data preparation and how it will assist you.[0-30]
 Create and implement at least 2 classification algorithms that will output a classification based on 
the Action: (class attribute) feature. Test these models and try to improve it as you see fit. Discuss 
your findings and final rational for choosing a particular classification algorithm.[0-40]
 Make a classification using your test data, using your final classification algorithm and comment on 
the accuracy differential between the training and testing set.[0-10
